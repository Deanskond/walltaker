<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
  Walltaker is inspired by the <a href="https://www.wallclaimer.com/">WallClaimer</a> app, which allows you to set the
  wallpaper of your friends phones. This however leads to some weird cases where people post stuff that'd be on your
  metaphorical blacklist. With that in mind, I wanted it to be restricted to <a href="https://e621.net">e621.net</a>
  results, with an enforced blacklist. This keeps you in control, but not <em>too much</em> control.
</p>

<h2>What do I need?</h2>
<p>
  Walltaker requires you to <strong>make an account on the website (here!) first.</strong> Once you have an account, you can generate
  links to send to friends/enemies, which will enqueue new wallpapers for your account. When you want to start seeing
  these new wallpapers, <strong>then you can download the companion apps listed below</strong> which is able to listen to wallpaper changes to any
  account. Enter your username, and then go about your day!

  Hey Gray, this app looks and feels ancient and weird; not horny at all.

<p>
  Yes, I know this isn't the best app imaginable. I wanted to make something with
  <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> for nostalgia. I'm still faster at cranking out
  an
  app in Rails than I am on anything else I actually work with on a day-to-day basis, tells you something, huh?
